![](https://nerdiy.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/www.nerdiy.de-20200717-184353-scaled.jpg)

pxlBlck is a system of hardware and software to set up an event indication system for your SmartHome. Various software and hardware options are available. Thanks to the integration in an EspEasy plug-in, the pxlBlck's can be automated without external automation software. In combination with external automation software (e.g. NodeRed, MQTT server, etc ...), various notifications such as a doorbell-, social media (e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook, ...)-, call notifications on mobile devices and landlines are possible.
